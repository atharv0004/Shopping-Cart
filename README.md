# Shopping Cart with Redux

A simple and dynamic shopping cart application built using React and Redux. This project demonstrates how to manage the state of the shopping cart using Redux for state management, enabling features like adding/removing products, updating quantities, and calculating the total price.

## Features
- **Add/Remove Products:** Users can add or remove products from the shopping cart.
- **Update Quantities:** Users can modify the quantity of each item in the cart.
- **Total Price Calculation:** The total price updates dynamically as items are added, removed, or their quantities are changed.
- **Persistent Cart:** The cart persists even after page reloads (using Redux state).

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Redux:** For managing global state.
- **JavaScript/ES6+:** For application logic.
- **CSS/Styled-components:** For styling.
